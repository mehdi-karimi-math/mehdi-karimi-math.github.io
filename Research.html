<!-- Operations of Complex Systems -->
<section>
    <h2>Operations of Complex Systems</h2>
    <p>
        My current research focuses on the <b>operations of complex systems</b>, with a special emphasis on 
        <b>modern power networks</b> and <b>healthcare analytics</b>. These systems are increasingly interconnected, 
        high-dimensional, and data-rich, requiring <b>scalable optimization algorithms</b> and 
        <b>machine learning techniques</b> to achieve efficiency, resilience, and cost-effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our <span style="color:red;">NSF-funded project</span>, I lead a team of four graduate students 
        to design <b>graph-based distributed optimization algorithms</b> for managing large-scale, 
        renewable-integrated power networks. This includes <b>intelligent network partitioning</b>, 
        decentralized decision-making, and developing robust algorithms that improve system reliability 
        and adaptability under evolving energy paradigms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In parallel, through a collaboration with <b>OSF HealthCare</b>, I co-lead an applied project 
        with three faculty members and six students, focusing on predicting healthcare claim counts 
        under the <b>Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)</b> using <b>machine learning</b> and 
        <b>deep learning</b>. We work with <b>real-world Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)</b> data, 
        addressing challenges like <b>high missingness</b> and feature integration to uncover key 
        drivers of healthcare costs and improve risk modeling.

<!-- Convex Optimization -->
<section>
    <h2>Convex Optimization & Domain-Driven Form</h2>
    <p>
        <span style="color:red;">Convex optimization</span> plays a central role in my research, 
        bridging theoretical elegance with practical applications across data science, signal processing, 
        control theory, and robust decision-making. A major focus has been developing efficient 
        <b>infeasible-start primal-dual interior-point methods</b> for optimization problems expressed 
        in the <b>Domain-Driven Form</b>, where feasible regions are described via 
        <b>self-concordant barrier functions</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        These algorithms form the foundation of my open-source solver, 
        <a href="DDS.html">Domain-Driven Solver (DDS)</a>, which provides robust certificates of 
        approximate optimality, infeasibility, and unboundedness. To further improve DDS performance, 
        Iâ€™m investigating techniques leveraging <b>second-order information</b> and 
        <b>efficient Hessian-vector products</b>.
    </p>

<!-- DDS Solver -->
<section>
    <h2>Domain-Driven Solver (DDS)</h2>
    <p>
        We have released <a href="DDS.html">DDS 2.2</a>, which supports a wide range of constraints, 
        including LP, SDP, quantum entropy, and hyperbolic programming. DDS is designed to be 
        <b>extensible</b>; by providing a new <b>self-concordant barrier</b>, researchers can 
        seamlessly add new constraint sets. DDS also demonstrates significant performance 
        improvements over traditional reformulations.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Quantum Entropy -->
<section>
    <h2>Quantum Entropy and Quantum Relative Entropy</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="qu-inf.jpg" alt="Quantum Entropy" style="width:350px;height:270px;">
        DDS supports constraints involving <b>quantum entropy</b> (QE) and 
        <b>quantum relative entropy</b> (QRE), enabling efficient solutions for quantum 
        information processing applications. DDS outperforms SDP-based approximations and continues 
        to evolve to handle larger, more complex QRE problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Current efforts focus on proving a conjectured <b>self-concordant barrier</b> for the 
        epigraph of the QRE function and improving derivative evaluation for matrix-based barrier functions.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Hyperbolic Programming -->
<section>
    <h2>Hyperbolic Programming</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="HBP.jpg" alt="Hyperbolic Programming" style="width:350px;height:270px;">
        Hyperbolic programming connects optimization with <b>sum-of-squares methods</b> and the 
        <b>generalized Lax conjecture</b>. DDS supports hyperbolic constraints expressed in 
        multiple formats: <b>monomial lists</b>, <b>straight-line programs</b>, and 
        <b>determinantal representations</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ongoing work includes designing <b>automatic differentiation techniques</b> for efficiently 
        computing derivatives of hyperbolic polynomials within DDS, leveraging ideas from 
        machine learning to scale computations.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Sum-of-Squares -->
<section>
    <h2>Sum-of-Squares and SDP Complexity</h2>
    <p>
        I investigate the <b>Turing machine complexity</b> of semidefinite programs (SDPs) 
        through the theory of <b>sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomials</b). Although approximate 
        solutions to SDPs are polynomial-time computable, the complexity of SDP feasibility 
        in the exact arithmetic model remains open.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond theory, SOS methods have driven advances in <b>approximation algorithms</b> 
        and <b>machine learning</b>, including sparse recovery and dictionary learning. 
        This line of work bridges deep mathematical structures with modern algorithmic demands.
