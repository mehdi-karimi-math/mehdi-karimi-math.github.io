<h2> About me </h2>
<p>   

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Math, Illinois State University. Before, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Florida Tech, a Research Data Scientist at Cerebri AI, 
 and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the  <a href="https://math.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/"> 
Department of Combinatorics and Optimization</a>, University of
Waterloo, working with 
<a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ltuncel/">Dr. Levent
Tuncel</a>. My research interests are designing
optimization algorithms, creating software packages including my DDS code for convex optimization
problems, optimization of modern power networks, and implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms for complicated engineering problems. You can read more about my research <a href="Research.html"> here</a>.
</p>

<p>
A new version of our optimization software package <a href="DDS.html"> Domain-Driven Solver (DDS) 2.2</a> was released in Januray 2024.
This new version has extensive updates for quantum relative entropy (QRE) programming. The current version can solve much larger instances of QRE programming. 
</p>

<p>
I love teaching, specially performing new methods of learning and teaching in classrooms. I have completed 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/fundamentals-university-teaching-program"> Fundamentals of 
University Teaching</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/certificate-university-teaching">
Certificate of University Teaching<a> programs. My Project was about implementing Peer-Instruction in mathematics.
