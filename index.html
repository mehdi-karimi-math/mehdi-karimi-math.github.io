<h2> About me </h2>
<p>   

I am an Assistant Professor at the Demartment of Methematics, Illinois Satate University. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the  <a href="https://math.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/"> 
Department of Combinatorics and Optimization</a>, University of
Waterloo, working with 
<a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ltuncel/">Dr. Levent
Tuncel</a>. My research in the last few years has been on designing
optimization algorithms, creating software packages including my DDS code for convex optimization
problems, and implementing machine learning and deep learning projects. You can read more about my research <a href="Research.html"> here</a>.
</p>

<p>
My optimization software package <a href="DDS.html"> Domain-Driven Solver (DDS) 2.0</a> was released on Nov 11th, 2020. I gave a talk  in a session “Optimization Modeling Software”
by MathWorks at INFORMS annual meeting. DDS solves a wide variety of convex optimization probelms. 
</p>

<p>
I love teaching, specially performing new methods of learning and teaching in classrooms. I have completed 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/fundamentals-university-teaching-program"> Fundamentals of 
University Teaching</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support-graduate-students/certificate-university-teaching">
Certificate of University Teaching<a> programs. My Project was about implementing Peer-Instruction in mathematics.
